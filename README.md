# Basic-XOR-File-Encryption
This is just a fun project.
The program will create files with "OD" extension, which are encrypted.
Encryption used is basic XOR key based encryption.
I know there are a lot of bugs and improvements and suggestions are always welcome.
I am using here DearImGUI for building GUI. It is a Bloat-free Graphical User interface for C++ with minimal dependencies developed by Omar Cornut
https://github.com/ocornut/imgui.git

Buiding this project is not a big deal, I have only uploaded the source code files and all dependencies directly.
Just build as usual Cpp program and add proper include directories path.
